# Lingo

Lingo has created a way for our users to enhance their language skills while reading the news. As a member of Lingo you will be able to read partially translated articles in either Spanish or French. The best part about Lingo is that it puts learning a new language in real world context so that our users can ultimately start reading in a second language. The more you Lingo, the more you learn!

Created using Spring MVC, H2 Database, Jsoup, Hibernate, and Angular.js.
